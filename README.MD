# RAM Filler

## About app + how to use

This code will be very useful for PC technicans, benchmarks, etc. Let's say you want to fill 1GB of RAM of your 2GB RAM laptop. You clone this repository, and then enter:

	python main.py 2048

It will fill 2GB of RAM of your laptop. Insted of 2048 you can enter even 1MB, or 128GB, if you need it.

## Attention!

I'm not sure about how safe this app is. As I know, fully filled RAM will not affect any parts of you computer, but probably it will just fully freeze him. Use this app without filling 1TB of RAM on your 1GB Raspberry PI! Add in one time +512MB-1GB, to find this point of affected performance in a bad way.
